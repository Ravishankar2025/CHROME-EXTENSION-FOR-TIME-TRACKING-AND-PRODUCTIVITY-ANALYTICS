Project Overview: Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics

Objective:

The purpose of this project is to develop a Chrome extension that allows users to track their time spent on various websites and provides detailed analytics to improve their productivity. The extension will categorize activities as productive or non-productive, provide real-time tracking insights, and generate reports to help users optimize their workflow and focus.

Scope:
- Platform: Google Chrome (targeting desktop users).
- Core Functionality: Track and analyze the time spent on websites, categorize usage, and provide productivity metrics.
- Target Audience: Professionals, freelancers, students, and anyone looking to improve their productivity by monitoring and managing time spent on the web.

Key Features:
1. Time Tracking:
   - Monitor and record the time spent on each website visited in the browser.
   - Track time in real-time with a running timer.
   - Categorize websites into productive and non-productive based on user-defined rules or pre-set categories (e.g., work-related sites vs. social media).
   
2.Productivity Analytics:
   - Provide insights into how much time is spent on productive vs. non-productive sites.
   - Display weekly or daily reports showing total time spent on various websites.
   - Visualize time usage with charts, graphs, and metrics (e.g., pie charts for productivity breakdown, line graphs for time spent over time).
   
3. Customizable Productivity Categories:
   - Users can define and customize their own categories of productive or non-productive websites.
   - Option to import predefined categories from popular productivity tools (e.g., Pomodoro timers, time management apps).
   
4. Focus Mode:
   - Enable a “Focus Mode” where distractions like social media sites or entertainment platforms are blocked or limited.
   - Customizable settings for how long websites can be accessed before a reminder or block is triggered.
   
5. Task Management Integration:
   - Integration with task management tools like Todoist, Trello, or Google Tasks to link time tracking with specific tasks or projects.
   - Option to assign time spent on websites to tasks for detailed productivity reports.

6. Daily/Weekly Reports:
   - Automatically generate and store time tracking reports, available to the user via a downloadable CSV, PDF, or in-app report viewer.
   - Insights on time management patterns and suggestions for improvement.

Technologies/Tools Involved:

- C PROGRAMMING
- API Integration: Integration with task management tools via their APIs (e.g., Todoist, Trello, or Google Tasks).
- Analytics: D3.js or Chart.js for generating visual analytics and reports.
- Notifications: Chrome Notifications API for reminders and alerts.
-Time Management: JavaScript-based time tracking with custom intervals.

Expected Outcomes:

- Enhanced Productivity: Users can gain insights into how their time is spent and identify time-wasting habits.
- Time Optimization: Users will be able to optimize their daily routine and improve their focus by managing time spent on distractions.
- Behavioral Insights: The extension will provide personalized suggestions to improve productivity based on usage patterns.
